Brief Introduction About Myself
I am Ubakaeze Prince Chibuike — healer by calling, dreamer by design. By day, I serve as a nurse at Eye Foundation Hospital, tending wounds and restoring hope. By night, I brew vitality through Purenex IV Nutrition Drips, crafting potions that awaken strength and clarity. Born under Lagos skies, I walk the crossroads of medicine, magic, and meaning — where science meets soul. With a stethoscope in one hand and vision in the other, I chase the quest to become a legend in healthcare, one heartbeat at a time.
